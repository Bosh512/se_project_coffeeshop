# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form, including numerous input types
- CSS animation and transform elements

## Plan on improving the project

-Once this project is conneected to an actual live server where it would send the inputs from the multiple forms on the page, it is likely that some additional cleanup will need to occur as more html is added to compromise this change.
-While it is out of the scope of this project, I think that a revamped color palette and suite of images would do this page well. Possibly something with warmer tones and colors to provide a more calming atmosphere to the page overall. The page generally consists of blue hues and cool tones I think clash with the page's overall concept and purpose, as well as many sort of generic images I think would be better replaced with real life images of the (obvisouly fictional and not real) location. I think this is a good example, but a darker and less overal generic color pallette would be ideal [https://www.cuppaaustin.com/].
